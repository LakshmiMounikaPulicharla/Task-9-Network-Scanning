# Task 9: Network Vulnerability Scanning

## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform network vulnerability scanning using Nmap to identify live hosts, open ports, running services, operating system details, and possible security risks in a local network.

## Tools Used
- Nmap  
- Ubuntu Linux  

## Target Information
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Network Range | 172.16.967.128/24 |
| Target Host | 172.16.96.129 |

## Steps Performed
- Discovered active devices in the network  
- Scanned the target system for open ports  
- Detected running services and versions  
- Identified the operating system  
- Performed vulnerability scanning  
- Analyzed security risks  
- Documented all findings  

## Files in This Repository
- task9.pdf – Final report  
- screenshots folder of task9 – Contains all scan evidence  

## Risk Summary
| Issue | Risk |
|-------|------|
| Web ports open | Remote access abuse |
| Outdated services | Known exploits |
| OS detected | Easier system profiling |

## Outcome
This task helped me understand how network reconnaissance is performed in real-world security testing. It also showed how identifying open ports and services is the first step in securing a network.
